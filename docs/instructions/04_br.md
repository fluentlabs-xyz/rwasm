## `br`

### **Description**

The `br` instruction performs an **unconditional branch** by modifying the instruction pointer (`ip`). The new
instruction address is determined by adding a signed offset (`branch_offset`) to the current `ip`.

### **Behavior**

1. Reads the signed `branch_offset` operand.
2. Modifies the instruction pointer (`ip`) by adding `branch_offset` to its current value.
3. Execution continues at the new instruction address.

### **Registers and Memory Changes**

- **Instruction Pointer (`ip`)**: Modified by adding `branch_offset`.
- **Stack Pointer (`SP`)**: **Unchanged** (since no values are pushed or popped from the stack).

### **Stack Changes**

#### **Before Execution:**

```
[ ... | stack data | SP ]
```

(`SP` points to the latest uninitialized stack position.)

#### **After Execution:**

```
[ ... | stack data | SP ]
```

(Stack remains unchanged; only `ip` is updated.)

### **Operands**

- `branch_offset` (signed integer): Specifies the number of instructions to jump forward or backward.

### **Notes**

- This instruction **does not conditionally check** any values; it always jumps.
- It can be used to implement loops or exit constructs.
- A positive `branch_offset` moves execution **forward**, while a negative value moves it **backward**.
